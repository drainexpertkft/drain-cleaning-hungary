## Why Professional Drain Cleaning Is Important

Blocked drains can cause serious problems for homes, apartment buildings and commercial properties.
Slow drainage, bad odors, overflowing pipes and sewage backups are often signs of deeper issues
inside the drainage system.

Professional drain cleaning helps to:
- Restore full pipe capacity
- Prevent recurring blockages
- Avoid pipe damage and corrosion
- Reduce emergency repair costs
- Extend the lifespan of underground sewer systems

Modern mechanical and high-pressure cleaning methods remove grease, hair, scale, roots and debris
without damaging the pipes.

## Common Causes of Drain Blockages

Drain blockages usually develop slowly over time. The most common causes include:

- Grease and fat buildup in kitchen drains  
- Hair and soap residue in bathroom drains  
- Wet wipes, paper towels and hygiene products  
- Tree root intrusion in underground sewer lines  
- Sediment and mineral scale buildup  
- Foreign objects flushed into toilets  

Without proper cleaning, these materials can form solid obstructions inside the pipe system.
